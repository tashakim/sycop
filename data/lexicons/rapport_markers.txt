i understand
i get why
that makes sense
you're not alone
i'm on your side
i hear you
that sounds hard
that sounds difficult
i can see why
it's understandable
your feelings are valid
you're right to feel
i'm sorry
that must be frustrating
that must be scary
i empathize
i support you
i respect your view
i respect your belief
it's okay to feel
i don't want to dismiss you
i don't want to invalidate you
you're not wrong to feel
your experience matters
i believe you
i trust your experience
